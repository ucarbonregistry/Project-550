Victus Dyeings, a prominent textile processing facility in Tirupur, has demonstrated its commitment
to sustainable water management through the establishment and expansion of its Effluent
Treatment Plant (ETP). Initially commissioned on 23rd September 1988 with a treatment capacity of
1.4 million litres per day (MLD), the ETP has been upgraded to handle 2.8 MLD to accommodate
increased operational demand. The current operational throughput stands at 1.9 MLD.

Rather than discharging treated effluent into the environment or relying on natural freshwater
sources, the plant follows a closed-loop treatment system that enables complete internal reuse of
water. The treated wastewater undergoes advanced purification through an in-house Reverse
Osmosis (RO) system, ensuring high-quality water recovery for process use.

To manage the RO reject stream, Victus Dyeings employs a technologically sophisticated Multiple
Effect Evaporator (MEE) system, combining both falling film and forced circulation techniques. This
setup allows for efficient evaporation, condensation, and subsequent reuse of the remaining water,
particularly in boiler feed and other industrial applications.

These interventions replace the need for freshwater in boiler feed and process applications,
promoting zero liquid discharge (ZLD) and significantly reducing the facility's water footprint. By
treating and reusing the entire volume of effluent internally, the project avoids environmental
discharge, conserves freshwater. 
______
In many developed and some developing countries, effluent is typically managed through:
(1) integration with domestic sewerage systems for dilution and further treatment, or
(2) marine discharge of treated effluent with high Total Dissolved Solids (TDS).

However, these options are not feasible for textile industries in Tirupur. In the first case, domestic
sewerage in the textile-concentrated areas of Tirupur remains untreated. Secondly, marine
discharge is impractical due to the nearest coastline being over 250 km away. Although the Noyyal
River flows through the region, the project proponent (PP), Victus Dyeings, has not been
permitted to discharge treated effluent via either sewerage systems or marine outlets.

Consequently, Victus Dyeings has adopted a self-reliant, advanced in-house effluent treatment
system that ensures complete reuse and zero surface discharge. A full-fledged Effluent Treatment
Plant (ETP) with an operational capacity of 1.9 MLD has been installed, supported by a Reverse
Osmosis (RO) system for effective TDS removal. The RO reject, which retains high TDS, is further
treated through a Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) consisting of five falling film and one forced
circulation effect. Here, the water is evaporated and condensed for reuse.

The concentrated slurry from the MEE is processed in a crystallizer to recover salts, which are
reused in the dyeing process. Despite the efficiency of the RO and MEE systems, the final TDS
concentration remains higher than the Pollution Control Board (PCB) standard of 1500 mg/L.
To ensure regulatory compliance and uphold sustainability, the facility has implemented a Zero
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system that enables complete water recovery and significantly reduces TDS
levels, avoiding any liquid discharge. Thus, in the absence of conventional disposal routes, Victus Dyeings has implemented a closedloop, resource-recovery-based solution, setting a benchmark in sustainable water management and industrial environmental protection.
The RoU program promotes wastewater treatment and reuse initiatives, thereby offering an
alternative to the release of wastewater through surface Discharge which could have an adverse
impact on soil Health.
